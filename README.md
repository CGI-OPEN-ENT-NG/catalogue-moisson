# Moissoncatalogue

This application was generated using JHipster 6.10.5, you can find documentation and help at [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.10.5](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.10.5).

## Development

To launch the environment locally, you can do

- If it's the first time:
```
./build.sh init logs
```
- Otherwise:
```
./build.sh start logs
```

You can change the PostGres and ElasticSearch port variables by creating the .env.dev file

To start harvesting manually you must run the following command:
```
./build.sh manualLaunch
```
You can debug your spring application on port 8002 by default.

### Migrate

When you create a new table for example, you must update the sql database. To do this after creating your model using javax.persistence annotations, you can do:
- To create the migration file
```
./build.sh diff
```
- To apply unapplied migration files to your database
```
./build.sh update
```

### Doing API-First development using openapi-generator

[OpenAPI-Generator]() is configured for this application. You can generate API code from the `src/main/resources/swagger/api.yml` definition file by running:

```bash
./mvnw generate-sources
```

Then implements the generated delegate classes with `@Service` classes.

To edit the `api.yml` definition file, you can use a tool such as [Swagger-Editor](). Start a local instance of the swagger-editor using docker by running: `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/swagger-editor.yml up -d`. The editor will then be reachable at [http://localhost:7742](http://localhost:7742).

Refer to [Doing API-First development][] for more details.

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the moissoncatalogue application for production, run:

```

./mvnw -Pprod clean verify


```

To ensure everything worked, run:

```

java -jar target/*.jar


```

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```

./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify

./mvnw -Pprod -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean


```

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./mvnw verify
```

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a postgresql database in a docker container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

```
./mvnw -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
```

Then run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.

## First installation for CRRE

When we launch harvesting for the first time, we will create the 2 elastic search indexes.
Following this, you must launch the following two requests on the elastics search
* curl -XPUT " {ElasticSearch_IP}/articlenumerique/_settings" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{"index" : {"max_result_window" : 100000}}'
* curl -XPUT "{ElasticSearch_IP}/articlepapier/_settings" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{"index" : {"max_result_window" : 100000}}'
